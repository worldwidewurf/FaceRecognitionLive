# Facial Recognition using OpenCV and face_recognition

This repository contains a Python project for performing facial recognition using the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries. The script captures video from a webcam, detects faces in the frames, and compares the detected faces with reference faces to determine if they match.

i plan to make this a little data science project that can be used to collect data that can later be used to analyze the data to check for patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- face_recognition library

You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to Use
Clone the repository or download the provided script to your local machine.

Make sure you have a working webcam .

Place a reference images in faces/images. This image will be used to compare detected faces with the reference face.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the script using the following command:

```python liveFaceRecMain.py```
